# HunchTime
Track predictions with friends!

## What is HunchTime?
Ever make casual predictions with friends and not remember what everyone picked (or that everyone had passionately made predictions which have since fallen off the radar)? With `HunchTime`, you can now track these predictions for just about anything, from sports outcomes and baby due dates to Oscar winners and presidential victors. You and your friends get to lock in your predictions and stand behind them, in addition to seeing whose gifts of prognostication are strongest over time. `HunchTime` keeps it fun and casual, with a touch of structure sprinkled in.

## How does HunchTime work?
It's really easy to get started. Just create a pool (a prediction group), use the simple Q&A-style prediction generator, and then invite your friends to make their own predictions! Your friends won't need to make an account (they will need to do so if they want to create their own pools) and simply need to fill-in one or two items to complete their prediction. Easy peasy. And then when time's up (usually when the event has occurred or an outcome has been determined), you and your friends will get a reminder to check and see who really knew what they were talking about.

## What powers HunchTime?
Tentatively, the technology that will power `HunchTime` will be a `Parse` backend and an `Enyo` frontend. This will allow for a snappy interface that matches the real-time power and speed of `Parse`, while allowing for easy scaling and feature addition without the need for building out our own backend initially. Additionally, we will explore an efficient integration of `Parse` with `Enyo`, as both are component-based JavaScript frameworks (in the case of the `Parse` JavaScript SDK).
